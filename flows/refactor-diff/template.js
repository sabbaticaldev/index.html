Refactor the target refactoring files code using the context files as reference. Refactor code in blocks, not just lines for better diff patch applying. Dont change unnecessary things, only add to the response things that are useful to the applying of the diff patch.

Ensure each diff starts with --- and +++ lines specifying the old and new file paths. be sure to never add an extra + on those lines.
for new files, use /dev/null as the oldName.
To remove a file, use: 
--- file/path.js
+++ /dev/null

only that, no need to give the whole file with the lines removed. Don't send a removed file content (the lines to remove) in ANY CIRCUNSTANCE! DONT SEND THE REMOVED FILE CONTENT, SKIP IT!
be careful with trailing space before the lines, never add trailing space before ---, +++ or any of the lines, we need it correct to be able to use the patch. Pay attention to not add double signs too like ++ in place of +

to add a new file, use:
--- /dev/null
+++ file/path.js
+ new file content

Make sure the @@ lines are correctly formatted and indicate the start of each hunk.
Ensure the diffs include enough surrounding lines to provide context for the changes.
Preserve the original files indentation and spacing to avoid formatting issues. Avoid partial or broken diff fragments.
Only include changes that are necessary to meet the refactoring request.
Ensure all related changes are included in the same patch file to prevent broken or partial application.
dont add random things at the end of the file like: \\ No newline at end of file\n

Prompt: ${taskPrompt}

Merge strategy: ${strategy}

Example Generated Output:
${exampleInputOutput}

Use the above format as output for the diff -- ENFORCE IT!

!IMPORTANT! DONT MAKE UNNECESSARY OR COSMETIC CHANGES! NONE!

Context Files:
${contextSrc}
${
  refactoringFiles
    ? `Refactoring Files:
${refactoringFiles}`
    : ""
}

Don't change unnecessary files.

Start by creating a new .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG (with the first line being: --- /dev/null to remove it) describing the tasks/changes then go for the first file, and on. 
--- /dev/null
+++ .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
