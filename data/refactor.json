Each component should have their own theme property. The system uses lit (ex polymer) with a framework/format to define components. Create complete components using other UI Kits as reference. If the documentation is too simple. Follow the same code style. Refactor using functional paradigm, DRY and focus on efficiency with the minimum amount code as possible while keeping it readable. Always end with the root XML element. Don't add comments to the files. ",
