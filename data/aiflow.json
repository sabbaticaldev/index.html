  "taskPrompt": "We are extracting an npm package called 'aiflow' from this server framework we are developing. The 'aiflow' package will handle workflow and LLM integration, leaving the user to integrate the templates and the operations tasks to execute. Let's create tasks related to extracting the necessary components, testing them, and creating documentation. Each major component of the 'aiflow' package should have its own tasks. Ensure the package is properly registered and configured for npm, and provide an example of how to integrate it into a project. create then under the path aiflow/. Lets use es2022 and no build, we will publish the code as is and the person importing is responsible for building. Make every step very well described so we dont make mistake. It is a JS workflow CLI tool node based that will be used to create AI CLI tools. It will also work as pure JS to be used in the frontend, framework-agnostic (not related to Lit or any framework). Using the context src files, create the aiflow framework and refactor the server/ project to use aiflow. The tasks/index.js, the tasks/ files, the services/, the things related to maps, instagram should stay in server. only the utils and engines core things related to LLM should move to aiflow."
