Project: sabbatical.dev

Objective: 
  - I plan on doing a a sabbatical year so the first 6 months I won't be looking for a job, just investing in personal growth
  - To learn the pain points of being a influencer to create software to optimize the process
  - To post about my sabbatical days until I find another 6 figures job
  

- terms: sabbatical gap, personal sabbatical, sabbatical year, tech, tech layoff

I should make a diary about every day of my sabbathical and create content for social media until I find a job as a software engineer again
- focus on improving myself
- THe idea  of sabbatical.dev is to take a break to develop myself in the way I want fulltime. This time I'm going to learn how to be a content creator
- Every week I will start with a new platform (Github, my website, TikTok, Youtube, instagram, ...)


Why I'm doing this?
- I'm recording and make it public every day of my sabbatical in order to make myself accountable and make the maximum of every day of this sabbatical year. Every day needs do be a special day.

- he started doing videos without audio and over time started to add audios and currently he talks a lot over the video

Day 1
- Planning (now)
- Write first post of sabbatical.dev - reference: https://www.instagram.com/p/C38c2DXSIQN

Day 2
- Create Github Project
- logo, 
- post First Day log

Day 3
- create website

Day 4, 5 - talk about sending a newsletter of MicroStartups.co

Strategy so far:
- start with github for daily updates, then website, then start learning how to create content for tiktok (based on inspirational.stories and similar content), get used to the tools to create good amount of quality content and start to post on tiktok. Important that the daily updates should talk about the road to become a content creator, that's the most important value to share. This info will be on github and my website and then maybe on tiktok and social media (with another account if the first one is already successful so to not mix content of inspirational quotes to take a sabbatical leave and my road to learning how to create content for social media)
