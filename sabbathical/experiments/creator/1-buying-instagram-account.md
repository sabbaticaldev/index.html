19 March
- posted a third video now from the app again with share on facebook (without a connected account) checked and selected 3 topics related to travel videos
- for this 3rd one I went to reels tab in the app, got a reel with trending audio, clicked on it and went to the list of trend audios and got one for the view, let's see if it impacts the performance
- The first reel that got views from facebook stopped growing
- Now I have 3 reels that I'll be comparing how they go

18 March
- First reels went to 900 views with views from Facebook
- Posted a new reel also from Rio but this time from the desktop web app. 
- It didn't have the option to share as a reel on facebook too which was the biggest drive of views in my first reel
- So far the post from the web have a better engagement with my own followers but only 100 views which is way less than the first one with views from facebook
- let's see if tomorrow it starts to show on Facebook and the views grow
- the web also don't let you add topics which probably is used for facebook

17 March
- First reels got 100 views in the first day
- posted a few stories from my camera roll to create engagement (but 25 people saw it lol)
16 March
- bought an instagram account for 200usd with 5k followers and following 3.5k people (@travelland223)
- tried to change email but Instagram didn't let me, probably because the login was in a new phone and new location. It said my account would be limited for a few days. Will try again later
- made first post, reposting a video from Rio de Janeiro


Why
- There is no reason to work my ass off to go from 0 to 5k which are the most difficult ones to get. I need an audience to get an audience with the current Instagram algorithm so why not pay 200usd to get a shortcut?
