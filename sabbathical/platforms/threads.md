If you like it, go for it. Every travel destination isn’t for everyone. Some ppl love Jamaica. Some love Cape Town. Others love Hong Kong. Love where you love. You’re allowed. It is ok.

Ever notice people here on Threads chatting up the algorithm about what they're into?

The explanation is in the comments section 👇

We've figured out that if you tell Threads what you're into — like dropping those direct hints to the app — it actually tunes your feed to show more of that stuff. For me, that means more travel vibes, content tips, and influencer insights. What about you? What do you wanna see showing up in your feed? Post in the comments and see by yourself if it works!

- Here's why we talk directly to the Threads algorithm (like in my previous post):

Most of our feed isn’t just from accounts we follow—about 80% is actually recommendations. So when we shout out our interests, we're telling the algorithm exactly what to show us. It’s a simple tweak to make sure we see more of what we like. Noticed a change in your feed from doing this? Mine's now full of travelers, digital nomads, and like-minded folks!
